				Programming II - Course Work 1

About The Program	

The program submitted uses Complex numbers to create fractals. There are 3 fractals made in this program.

1. Mandelbrot Set - Made using Complex Numbers
2. Julia Set- Made using the Co-ordinates received from the Mandelbrot set
3. Burning Ship Fractal - Made using Complex Numbers

How The Program Works

1. The Program is made in java and hence requires the latest version of the JDK along with a compiler to compile and run the java code
2. To choose a favourite co-ordinate the user has to click on the co-ordinate in the Mandelbrot set panel. And the co-ordinate will be added to the drop down menu
3. To Zoom into the Mandelbrot set the user has to drag the mouse over the area he/she wants to zoom into.
4. To exit the Program simply close the window.

Extensions Done

1. Added animation while chasing the Julia set and moving over it.
2. Made BurningShip Fractal.
